# startup_name_generator

A simple app that generates proposed names for a startup company. The user can select and unselect names, saving the best ones. The code lazily generates 10 names at a time. As the user scrolls, more names are generated. There is no limit to how far a user can scroll.

The animated GIF below shows how the app works:
